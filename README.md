## Educators

This class assumes the educator knows how to program and provision Raspberry Pi's. 

### BOM

Bill of Materials for this class is:

* \>$14 - Raspberry Pi - Pi 4 was used in screen shots, but any should work. This base price is 
for a Pi Zero W with headers.
* $9 - Squid Combo Pack - two buttons and an RGB LED
* $10 - 16 GB Micro SD card
* $10 - Pi power supply with cable
* $5 - HDMI cable
* \>$0 - Keyboard and Mouse (ideally donated or purchased at a used shop for cheap)

For the day of 

We've had great luck purchasing from [Chicago Electronic Distributors](https://chicagodist.com/). As we're a 
tax exempt non-profit, they didn't charge us tax, gave us educational discounts and generally were a
joy to work with.  That said, they don't sell the Pi Zero, so the $14 base price above isn't attainable through them.
